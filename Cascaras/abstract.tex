Recommender systems provide users with choices based on their preferences, providing a convenient and quick way to find items of interest. For this process to be effective, however, the user must be able to understand the recommendations and trust the system to find what they are looking for. This confidence can be achieved through the use of explanations, which are an intuitive way to justify the choice of recommendations in a way that is understandable to the user.\\

In this project we want to enrich the explanations for a music recommender using Linked Data. A study of this technology and the ways in which it can be applied to the scope of the recommendation systems will be made and demonstrated in a practical way with the development of the prototype of an application that obtains and shows explanations for the above-mentioned recommended.\\
